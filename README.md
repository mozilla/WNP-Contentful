# WNP-Contentful

We, Firefox User Journey team, are currently prototyping with [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) to explore the feasibility of using a 3rd party CMS to facilitate the content needs in our daily work.

This repo includes several components for this prototype.

* [`contentful-extensions`] - A collection of Contentful UI extensions for the content creation
* [`contentful-proxy`] - A proxy which brings the content generated on Contentful to the final consumer, in this case, is the What's-New-Panel (WNP) feature of Firefox
